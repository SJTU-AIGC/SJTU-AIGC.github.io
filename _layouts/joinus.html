<h4 class="fw-bold pb-1 mb-2">Background</h4>
<p>From Sobel and Canny's digital image processing algorithms to detect edges in images, to deep learning algorithms like R-CNN and YOLO for object detection in images, from GANs to Diffusion Models, and from 2D to 3D, deep learning models demonstrate the potential for infinite content generation.</p>
<p>From ChatGPT to ERNIE Bot, from MidJourney to DALLÂ·E, AI-generated content applications have rapidly expanded. AI-generated content (AIGC) is becoming integral to our lives, poised to be a key driver in media, culture, and creative industries.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2023, the Student Innovation Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), in collaboration with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence of SJTU, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Lenovo Group, and Lilith Games, established the "Shanghai Jiao Tong University AIGC Class" to cultivate the next generation of AIGC talents, addressing the urgent need for highly specialized professionals in the AIGC field.</p>

<h4 class="fw-bold pb-1 mb-2">Faculty</h4>
<p>The Shanghai Jiao Tong University AIGC Class boasts a diverse and outstanding faculty, supporting comprehensive student development in the AIGC domain. The faculty includes distinguished teachers from the SJTU Student Innovation Center and the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, as well as top engineers from the industry.</p>
<p>The Student Innovation Center's Innovation Practice Department has 15 full-time teachers, 15 internal mentors, and 30 external experts, providing a comprehensive "course-competition-creation" education service to SJTU students.</p>
<p>The Institute of Artificial Intelligence has over a hundred faculty members. The Visual Intelligence Research Center focuses on integrating human-machine interactions, aiming at the scientific forefront of artificial intelligence and computer vision, developing new-generation visual intelligence theories and technologies characterized by comprehensive perception, behavioral cognition, virtual-real integration, and security. It aims to enhance visual perception and cognitive abilities in digital media, smart cities, smart healthcare, and other fields, realizing the vision of AI-powered new perspectives.</p>

<h4 class="fw-bold pb-1 mb-2">Advanced Equipment</h4>
<div class="flex-container">
    <div class="flex-text">
        <p><strong>Optical Motion Capture System:</strong></p>
        <p>The motion capture equipment is equipped with the advanced Optitrack optical motion capture system, including 20 high-precision Optitrack PrimeX22 cameras, multiple motion capture suits, and supporting software.
